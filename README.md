# Python Data Structures and OOPS Concepts

This project focuses on Python data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, along with object-oriented programming (OOPS) concepts and string manipulation. It serves as a learning resource and code reference for anyone interested in understanding and working with these fundamental concepts in Python.
## Data Structure

### Lists
    Lists are ordered, mutable collections of elements. They can contain elements of different types and support operations like adding, removing, and accessing elements.

### Tuples
    Tuples are ordered, immutable collections of elements. They are similar to lists but cannot be modified once created.

### Dictionaries
    Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. They provide fast lookup and retrieval of values based on unique keys.

### Sets
    Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They support operations like adding, removing, and performing set operations like union and intersection.


## OOPS

### Classes and Objects
    Classes are blueprints for creating objects, and objects are instances of classes. They encapsulate data and behavior into a single entity.

### Inheritance
    Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. It enables code reuse and promotes a hierarchical organization of classes.

### Polymorphism
    Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as interchangeable. It enables code to be written that can work with objects of multiple types.

## String Manipulation
    Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.

### isalpha
- Returns True if all characters in the string are in the alphabet

### isdigit
- Returns True if all characters in the string are digits

### capitalize
- Converts the first character to upper case

### casefold
- Converts string into lower case

### count
- Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string

### encode
- Returns an encoded version of the string

### endswith
- Returns true if the string ends with the specified value

### find
- Searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

### index
- Searches the string for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found

### isalnum
- Returns True if all characters in the string are alphanumeric


### partition
- Returns a tuple where the string is parted into three parts

### reverse
- Return a reverse string
